//* To make the file executable:
//? From the terminal, run:
//* chmod +x index.js

//* From there, we are able to execute the file by running:
//? ./index.js
//* BUT, the terminal doesn't know to run the file with node
//? In other words, it is trying to read it is a shell script

//* To get around that, we need to tell the terminal to use Node.js
//* We do that by putting a shebang at the top of the file
//? #! /usr/bin/env node <-- this is a shebang

//* We then create the package.json file manually, like so:
// {
//   "name": "sharif",      //* the name of the package on the npm registry
//   "version": "1.0.0",
//   "bin": {
//     "sharif": "index.js" //* the name of the command to run
//   }
// }

//* After creating the package.json, we can then run:
//? npm link
//* Don't worry too much about the details;
//? Just know that it makes developing npm packages easier
